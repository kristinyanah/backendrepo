# enzyme-promiscuity
---

A comprehensive web platform that predicts enzyme promiscuity and the products of enzyme-substrate reactions.


## Setup

Note that you will need to unzip the `dataset_zip.zip` file before running the model training or testing code. The unzipped folder *cannot* be committed to Git because Git does not allow files > 100Mb in its history.

Please note that if you commit any of those files, you must erase them from Git history (or erase that last commit) before you can push *anything* to the repo.
